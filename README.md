basics to start development


```
git clone <this repo url>
cd <this repo dir>
npm install
npm run start
```

wait for a bit, then the browser will open to http://localhost:3000/# and you'll see the home screen.
When you edit any file in `/src` the app will automatically reload.
Edit `App.css` or `index.css` as needed.
